We're using AWS Cloud Provider and will take advantage of environment variables for authenticating to AWS.

Environment Variables for AWS Authentication
1. **AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID** && **AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY**
2. **AWS_PROFILE**

There are various other methods to authenticate to AWS. You can refer to this link https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs to read more about AWS Authentication.
